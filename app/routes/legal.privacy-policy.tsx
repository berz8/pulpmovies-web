        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

        possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in
        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and
        isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

          nor will it affect the processing of your personal data conducted in
          reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
